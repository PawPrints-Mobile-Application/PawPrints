          <p>
            <em>In Short:</em> We collect personal information that you provide

          </p>

          <p>

            information.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Application Data.</strong> If you use our application(s), we
            also may collect the following information if you choose to provide
            us with access or permission:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Geolocation Information.</strong> We may request access or

              device, either continuously or while you are using our mobile
              application(s), to provide certain location-based services. If you
              wish to change our access or permissions, you may do so in your

              purposes.

            2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?

          </p>

          <p>
            We process your personal information for a variety of reasons,

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To facilitate account creation and authentication and otherwise

            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="share-personal-information">
            3. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>In Short:</em> We may share information in specific situations
            described in this section and/or with the following third parties.
          </p>

          <p>
            We may need to share your personal information in the following
            situations:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> We may share or transfer your
              information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any
              merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all
              or a portion of our business to another company.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Other Users:</strong> When you share personal information
              (for example, by posting comments, contributions, or other content
              to the Services) or otherwise interact with public areas of the
              Services, such personal information may be viewed by all users and
              may be publicly made available outside the Services in perpetuity.
              Similarly, other users will be able to view descriptions of your
              activity, communicate with you within our Services, and view your
              profile.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="keep-information">
            4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>In Short:</em> We keep your information for as long as necessary
            to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless
            otherwise required by law.
          </p>

          <p>
            We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
            necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
            longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as
            tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this
            notice will require us to keep your personal information for longer
            than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
          </p>

          <p>
            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
            personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
            information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
            personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we
            will securely store your personal information and isolate it from
            any further processing until deletion is possible.
          </p>

          <h2 id="privacy-rights">5. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
          <p>
            <em>In Short:</em> You may review, change, or terminate your account
            at any time.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your
            consent to process your personal information, which may be express
            and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the
            right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your
            consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details
            provided in the section "<a href="#contact-us"
              >HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a
            >" below.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the
            processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows,
            will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted
            in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
          </p>

          <p>
            Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or
            delete your account and information from our active databases.

            fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations,
            enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal
            requirements.

          <h2 id="do-not-track">6. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
          <p>
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
            applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you
            can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
            about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At
            this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
            implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
            currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
            automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If
            a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
            future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version
            of this privacy notice.
          </p>

          <h2 id="updates-to-notice">7. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h2>
          <p>
            <em>In Short:</em> Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to
            stay compliant with relevant laws.
          </p>

          <p>
            We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated
            version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date, and the
            updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we
            make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you
            either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by
            directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this
            privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting
            your information.
